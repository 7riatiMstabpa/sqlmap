Imogen Heap is a British singer-songwriter and producer who has been making innovative and captivating music since the late 1990s. Her second solo album, *Speak For Yourself*, released in 2005, is a showcase of her talent and versatility, blending electronic sounds with organic instruments and vocals. The album features 12 tracks that range from upbeat pop-rock to haunting ballads, all written and produced by Heap herself.
 
One of the most popular songs on the album is "Hide and Seek", which was featured on the TV show *The O.C.* and became a viral hit. The song is composed entirely of Heap's voice, processed through a vocoder and layered into harmonies. The result is a stunning and emotional piece that sounds like nothing else. Another highlight is "I Am In Love With You", which combines a funky groove with ghostly backing vocals and a catchy chorus. The song showcases Heap's ability to create complex and interesting arrangements using electronic elements.
